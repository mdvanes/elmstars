Approach diverges from these articles because Elm 0.19 is used. 

* elm-package install is now `elm make`
* elm-package.json is now `elm.json`

Approach diverges because CRA was ejected to be able to edit the webpack config.

# Todo

* Convert to TS
* Show 2D star map animation based on ![design](https://github.com/mdvanes/elmstars/raw/master/src/design.jpg "Design")
* Integrate into bigger application
* Publish
* Fix Medium posts by also converting to Elm
* optional: API calls for star map
